@inject NavigationManager Nav

@* 
  Why this file exists (MAUI only):
  - Shared Nav uses "/" for the Home link so both hosts (Web + MAUI) can share the same markup.
  - The MAUI app’s real home is at "/maui-home", so this page catches "/" and redirects there.
  - This does NOT affect the web host; UI has its own "/" in a separate process.

  When it's safe to delete:
  - If you change MAUI’s Home to live at "/" directly, or
  - If you introduce a single Shared Home page at "/".

@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        // Redirect immediately to MAUI’s home. Using forceLoad=true is fine in WebView.
        Nav.NavigateTo("/maui-home", true);
        // If you prefer to keep it purely client-side and preserve SPA history, you can use:
        // Nav.NavigateTo("/maui-home");
    }
}
